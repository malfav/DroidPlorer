### Droid Plorer is a comprehensive, professional Android system monitoring and analysis tool. It combines features similar to Process Explorer, Process Hacker, and Process Monitor but is designed specifically for Android devices. Here’s what it does:

### Real-Time Process Monitoring:

1. It tracks process creation, termination, and state changes (e.g., suspended processes), displaying detailed information such as parent/child relationships and process status.

### Network and File Activity Tracking:
1. It monitors network connections and file activities in real time, filtering out noise to provide accurate insights into system and app behavior.

### Package Analysis:

1. When a new package is installed or when you select an app, Droid Plorer performs an in-depth analysis—displaying information on libraries, permissions, activities, API calls, receivers, services, providers, and file usage.

### User-Friendly Dashboard:

1. The tool features an advanced, color-coded dashboard that highlights key events (green for new processes, red for terminated ones, yellow for suspended) and organizes detailed system data across multiple tabs.

### ADB Integration:

1. It operates seamlessly when an Android device is connected via ADB, ensuring that all monitoring and analysis are both real-time and accurate.

### Droid Plorer offers a rich set of features tailored for in-depth Android system monitoring and analysis. Key features include:

* Real-Time Process Monitoring:

* Tracks the creation, termination, and state changes (e.g., suspension) of processes in real time. Displays detailed information including user, PID, PPID, and status, with a color-coded interface (green for new, red for killed, yellow for suspended).

## Network Activity Monitoring:

### Continuously monitors active network connections, capturing details like protocol, local and remote addresses, and connection states.

## File Activity Monitoring:
* Filters and logs file system activities by monitoring logcat output for file-related operations (such as file open, read, and write events), reducing noise and ensuring accurate results.

## Package Monitoring & Analysis:
* Detects newly installed packages and maintains an updated list of all installed apps. When a package is selected, it performs in-depth analysis, breaking down key aspects such as:

* 1. Libraries
* 1. Permissions
* 1. Activities
* 1. API Calls
* 1. Receivers
* 1. Services
* 1. Providers
* 1. Files

### Advanced Dashboard:

### Features a professional, modern UI with multiple tabs for processes, packages, file activity, network activity, and app analysis. The dashboard provides real-time logs and detailed views for deeper investigation.

### ADB Integration:

* Operates seamlessly when an Android device is connected via ADB, ensuring that monitoring and analysis are both accurate and up-to-date.

### Background Analysis:

* Runs in the background to continuously filter and process data, minimizing false positives and junk results, and ensuring that all insights are based on real-time system events.
